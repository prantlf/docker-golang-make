# prantlf/golang-make

[Docker] image: Go language on Alpine Linux with Make

[This image] is supposed to build and test applications written in [Go]. They often use `make` as a build tool, which is added by this image. This image is built automatically on the top of the tag [`alpine`] from the [golang repository], so that it always runs the current version of [Go] in the latest [Alpine Linux]. [Make] has to be updated from time to time by triggering a new build manually.

If you have trouble pulling the image from the Docker's default hub.docker.com, try gitlab.com, where [this project] is primarily maintained: `registry.gitlab.com/prantlf/docker-golang-make`.

## Tags

- [`latest`], `1.19`, `1.17`, `1.16`, `1.15`, `1.14`

## Install

    docker pull prantlf/golang-make
    # or a specific tag
    docker pull prantlf/golang-make:1.15

## Use

Just like the image from the [golang repository]. You will be able to call `make` in addition to `go`. You can either create your own image based on this one, or you can use it directly to build a Go project. For example, build from sources in the current directory, where you have the `Makefile`:

    docker run --rm -it -v "${PWD}":/work -w /work \
      prantlf/golang-make clean all

If you need to install some global dependencies, which `go build` does not do automatically, or if you need to execute `go generate`, you can introduce a special target `prepare` for these steps and insert it between `clean` and `all` to the command line, for example.

## Build, Test and Publish

The local images are built as `golang-make` with the appropriate tags and pushed to the docker hub as `prantlf/golang-make` with the same tags.

    # remove the old local images
    make clean
    # Check the syntax of the Dockerfiles
    make lint
    # update the local parent images
    make pull
    # build new local images and tag them
    make build
    # test the local images
    make test
    # enter an interactive shell inside a local image
    make shell VERSION=latest
    # run make using the created image
    make run VERSION=latest
    # login to the docker hub
    make login
    # push the local images to the docker hub
    make push
